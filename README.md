# Practice

This is my first code that I uploaded on GitHub.  
It is a basic example demonstrating the use of heading tags in HTML.  

## Heading Tags and Their Importance

HTML provides six heading tags, each with its own significance and use:

1. `<h1>` - The most important heading, usually used for the main title.
2. `<h2>` - A subheading, used for major sections.
3. `<h3>` - A subheading under `<h2>`, often used for subsections.
4. `<h4>` - A less important subheading, typically for smaller divisions.
5. `<h5>` - A minor heading, rarely used.
6. `<h6>` - The least important heading, generally used for fine print or additional details.

In HTML, headings help structure content and improve readability, as well as SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

## Summary  

This project is a simple demonstration of HTML heading tags and their importance.  
It is my first code upload on GitHub, and I look forward to learning more! ðŸš€
